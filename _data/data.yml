  title: About Joseph
  summary: |
    Joseph is a highly-focused, driven, detail-oriented Adobe Commerce Certified Developer who enjoys integrating 
    Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source with various third-party platforms. He has built extensions for payment 
    providers, transactional SMS messaging, fraud detection, and online auction services. 
    
    Joseph has more than 25 years of development experience (since 1999) with HTML, CSS, SASS, LESS, PHP, JavaScript, 
    XML, and other development languages and technologies. He is also knowledgeable in the creation and implementation 
    of development processes and best practices. He is always trying to learn new things, for example, how to build 
    integrations with the up and coming Shopware e-commerce application.
  
    Joseph's work always speaks volumes for itself in the cleanliness and efficiency of the code that he writes. He 
    always follows well-established, industry standard best practices in everything that he does. All of his code is 
    stored in a version control repository, using Git. He writes unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests 
    and uses static analysis tools such as PHPStan to ensure that his code is as bug-free as possible.
  
    In addition to his development skills, Joseph is also knowledgeable in the practice of automating code quality and 
    testing processes using continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platforms such as GitHub Actions.
  
    When Joseph is not building integrations or learning something new, he loves to spend his free time participating 
    in many personal hobbies, including traveling to exotic places and riding his motorcycle.

        I had the pleasure of working closely with Joseph during his time at Bold, where he played a pivotal role in 
        our Magento practice. Joseph consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of complex Magento / Adobe Commerce 
        solutions, quickly grasping challenges, formulating effective resolutions, and successfully delivering 
        high-quality outcomes.
  
        His contributions were instrumental in setting the standard for how we approached and executed Magento 
        solutions. Joseph is not only an exceptional problem solver but also a team player, always willing to 
        collaborate through pair programming and support colleagues without hesitation. His extensive experience with a 
        variety of programming languages and frameworks, honed over decades, makes him an invaluable asset to any team.
  
        On a personal note, I always looked forward to our conversations, as Joseph frequently introduced new and 
        innovative approaches to improving our CI/CD. His ability to share knowledge and drive continuous learning was 
        one of the highlights of our working relationship. Joseph is a true professional, and I wholeheartedly recommend
        him for any role that requires technical expertise, problem-solving, and a passion for delivering excellence.

        I highly recommend Joseph Leedy for a role as a Developer. Joseph was always willing to go above and beyond to 
        ensure our project's success through new development initiatives and supporting us when issues arose. His 
        technical expertise and attention to detail are impressive. Joseph also excels in keeping on top of the latest 
        industry trends and best practices by taking classes, researching and reading. He is also a great communicator 
        and collaborator. He will work through a problem to its resolution; with his tenacity and desire to understand 
        the root cause of the problem/use case. He also offers automated solutions rather than a manual workaround, 
        whenever possible. Overall, I am pleased to recommend Joseph for any development role.

        I have known and worked with Joseph [since 2014]. He is one of the most focused and productive developers I 
        know. Joseph is industrious and creative in his approach to solving difficult technical problems and will 
        think outside the box to come up with solutions to problems.
  
        Joseph has helped our team at Wagento grow and has been an important part of our Magento / Adobe practice. He 
        participates in our Center of Excellence and is a continual inspiration with his ideas and knowledge of the 
        product.
  
        I would highly recommend Joseph for any and all e-commerce projects.

      recommendation: |
        I had the opportunity to work with Joseph as a client of his while Joseph was at ParadoxLabs. Joseph was always 
        an absolute pleasure to work with: extremely dedicated to both the quality of the work he did and the 
        satisfaction of the client.
        
        I admired the fact that Joseph was not only skilled at the technical side of the work but also very adept at 
        communicating with the client: I trusted and appreciated Joseph's insight. Joseph would absolutely be one of 
        the people I could point to as being a great resource for me during the course of my career. I feel really 
        strongly that you have to not only admire and appreciate a professional's technical skill set in doing the work 
        you have commissioned them to do but you also have to trust that the person doing the work will always have 
        your best interests at heart, you can trust them, and that they'll look out for you. I can say with confidence 
        that Joseph is that kind of person and that kind of professional - I'm hoping our paths will cross again and 
        I'll have the pleasure of working with Joseph on future projects!
